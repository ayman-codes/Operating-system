<ul>
<li>Binary tree is data structure in which each node has at most two children</li>
<li>The two nodes are <b>Right child & Left child</b></li>
<li>The topmost node is the root node (the parent)</li>
<li><b>Used for</b> </li>

<ol>
<li>representing hierarchical representations between two data</li>
<li>Searching and sorting data</li>
<li>Construction data compression algorithm</li>
<li>In OS they're often used in the implementation of process scheduling algorithm, Specifically the binary tree data structure can be used to maintain a sorted list of processes</li>
</ol>

<br>
<li> the root of the tree representing the highest priority process in the system. As new processes are created or existing processes are preempted, the binary tree can be updated to maintain the correct ordering of processes. This allows the operating system to efficiently select the next process to run, based on its priority, without having to search through all processes in the system each time a scheduling decision needs to be made.</li>
<li>In addition, binary trees can be used in file systems to represent the hierarchical structure of directories and files. Each node in the tree corresponds to a directory or file, and the left and right children of a node represent its subdirectories and files, respectively. This allows for efficient traversal and searching of the file system.</li>
</ul>
